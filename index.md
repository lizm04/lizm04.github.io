# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Lizbeth Munoz and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is currently undeclared.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 is one of my favorite labs as it showed us how to clone, commit, add, and push our code to github. Knowing this is crucial for the rest of the labs as we do the same in each lab at the beginning and end. It was one of our first labs and as someone who did not know much about coding before this course I felt very excited learning the basics. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 part one was one that I really enjoyed. This part of the lab is Command Line Mad Lib which is where we wrote a program that fills in the blanks for a sentence about a sandwich order. This is where I learned how to properly format code, for example how to line up the code where it belongs. Formatting was important to get the code to pass the format test.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 is also one of my favorites, it has two parts, the first part is my favorite. It was Date Difference with Functions, I felt that during this part I knew exactly what I was doing. This felt accomplished to myself as I had not coded before this course so the fact that I was not lost and knew what code to use, felt exciting.
